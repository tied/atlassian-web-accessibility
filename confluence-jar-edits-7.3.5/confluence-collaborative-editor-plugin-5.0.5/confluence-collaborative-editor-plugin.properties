collab.opt-in.label=Collaborative Editing
collab.opt-in.title=Collaborative Editing
collab.opt-in.preamble=Collaborative editing takes teamwork to the next level by letting you and your team work \
  together in real time on software requirements, meeting notes, retros, and any other Confluence page. \
  See who''s editing the page with you, and see changes as they happen.
collab.opt-in.preamble2=Changes save and sync automatically, so everyone editing sees the same thing. \
  And, because we''re saving all the time, there''s no need to manually save. \
  Publish now or keep the draft and publish it later&mdash;you''re in control.
collab.opt-in.diagram-img.alt=Collaborative editing session

collab.opt-in.button.label=Turn on collaborative editing
collab.opt-in.true-collab.title=Real-time collaboration
collab.opt-in.true-collab.desc=Work together with your team and see their changes in real time.
collab.opt-in.no-conflicts.title=No more merge conflicts
collab.opt-in.no-conflicts.desc= Collaborative editing uses shared drafts, so there''s no need to merge because you''re \
  all working on the same page.
collab.opt-in.no-save.title=No need to save. We''re on it
collab.opt-in.no-save.desc=Changes are auto-saved as you make them, so now your only decision is when to publish.
collab.opt-in.for-keeps.title=Once on, it''s on for keeps
collab.opt-in.for-keeps.desc=Collaborative editing makes some under-the-hood changes to your instance. If you choose to \
   turn it on, you can''t turn it off after trying it.
collab.opt-in.changes-to-audit.title=Limited content auditing
collab.opt-in.changes-to-audit.desc=We don''t yet have the same auditing capabilities with collaborative editing. \
  All page changes are currently attributed to the person that publishes the page, rather than the person who made \
  each specific change.
collab.opt-in.no-versioning.title=Changes in drafts aren''t versioned
collab.opt-in.no-versioning.desc=We''re saving all the time in collaborative editing, but we don''t save versions in a \
   draft. When restoring an earlier page version, you can only roll back to published versions \
   (the page draft is deleted when you restore a previous version).
collab.opt-in.changes-to-drafts.title=Changes to drafts
collab.opt-in.changes-to-drafts.desc1=It''s fair to say that drafts are a somewhat misunderstood part of Confluence. Here''s the skinny:
collab.opt-in.changes-to-drafts.desc2=Previously, every time you edited a page but didn''t save it, \
  Confluence would create a draft of the page that was only visible to you&mdash;we call these personal drafts. \
  A page that only you can view is obviously no good for collaborative editing.
collab.opt-in.changes-to-drafts.desc3=Now that collaborative editing is here, Confluence creates a draft \
  whenever anyone edits a page and doesn''t publish their changes, and all page editors work on the same (shared) draft. \
  Because everyone''s working on the same draft, the stakes are a little higher when you want to discard a shared draft. \
  You can still do it, but we''ll warn you that you may also be discarding changes made by your teammates.
collab.opt-in.active=Collaborative editing is live!
collab.opt-in.disabled.title=Coming soon!
collab.opt-in.disabled=Collaborative editing isn''t available for your Confluence site just yet. We''ll let you know as soon as it is.

collab.synchrony.disabled=We''ve temporarily disabled collaborative editing. We''ll let you know as soon as it''s back in business.
collab.opt-in.confirm=Hit OK to confirm you''re ready to enable collaborative editing on your Confluence site.

  possible. <a {0}>Create an issue</a> if you come across a bug, or just to let us know what you think.
